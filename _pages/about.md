My background is in software development, predominantly Windows desktop applications based on the .net frameworks. I then transitioned into web development and quickly got into cloud computing platforms, here focusing particularly on MS Azure. From there I specialized in software architecture and took on a global software architect role. 

My responsibilities here included amongst others 
- Designing and implementing an IoT architecture spanning multiple business models and application 
- Designing and implementing a vulnerability management program and
- Overseeing multiple products in regards of architecture and security
- Product security across a global set of software products

My activities in the web3 crypto area include 
- Contributions to major open-source blockchain projects
- Investigating smart contract platforms incl. cosmos ecosystem, polygon, avalanche and binance smart chain
- Dabbling with smart contracts, mainly CosmWasm and Solidity
- Investigations into general Blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, consensus algorithms, FinTec and decentralization
- Dabbling in DeFi, NFTs and PoS
