## Hi and welcome to my portfolio
  
>By day I'm a software <!-- and product security  -->architect in the regulated medical environment  
 
>By night I love to dive into the world of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and web3.0
  
My background is in software development, Windows desktop applications based on the .net frameworks. I then transitioned into web development and  quickly got into cloud computing platforms, here focusing on MS Azure. My enthusiasm for clean code and my affinity towards understanding systems led me to specialize in software architecture, and so I took on a global software architect role.  
 
My curiosity in security and the need to fulfill ever growing requirements from clients as well as regulatory bodies drove me to assess my companies security posture and so I fell down the rabbit hole of cybersecurity.  
 
Nowadays my main focus is cybersecurity, product security to be more specific.  
 
My responsibilities here included amongst others:

- Design, implement and maintain a modern IoT architecture spanning multiple business models and applications
- Design and develop a vulnerability management program
- Oversee a portfolio of desktop and cloud products in regards of architecture
- Product security across a global set of software products
 
My crypto & blockchain activities include:

- Contributions to major open-source blockchain projects
- Exploring smart contract platforms incl. cosmos ecosystem, polygon & avalanche 
- Creating smart contracts, mainly based on CosmWasm and Solidity
- Investigating general Blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, consensus algorithms, FinTec and decentralization
- Experimenting with DeFi, NFTs, Play2Earn, PoS and governance
