I recently participated in TryHackMe's [Advent of Cyber 2022](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber4), a 24-day event that provided a fun and enjoyable experience while also allowing me to learn something new every day. The event's awesome storyline, including a comic, advanced each day and was interwoven with the day's tasks, accompanied by some awesome photos like the one below with the bad boy Yeti and Santa's stolen gifts. Additionally, each day, a cybersecurity content creator was featured with a walkthrough, explanations and additional information on the topic.
