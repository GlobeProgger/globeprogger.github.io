## Introduction

I recently completed the "CosmWasm Smart Contracts Basics" course from the CosmWasm Academy. It was an exciting learning experience for me, and I am excited to share some of the details of this course.

## Course Details

The "CosmWasm Smart Contracts Basics" course was well-structured, starting with an introduction to blockchain and smart contracts, followed by hands-on training on the CosmWasm framework. I learned about the key concepts of smart contracts and how they operate on blockchain networks. The course provided a comprehensive overview of the CosmWasm framework and its features, enabling me to gain an understanding of the blockchain ecosystem.

During the course, I also gained insights into various programming languages such as Rust, and their applications in developing smart contracts. The course materials were well-organized and delivered through interactive videos, tutorials, quizzes, and practical assignments. The practical assignments were particularly helpful in enabling me to understand the concepts better and apply them to real-world scenarios.

## Course Challenges

Like any learning experience, the course had its fair share of challenges. One of the primary challenges I faced was understanding the Rust programming language, which was entirely new to me. I had no prior experience with Rust, and it took some time to get used to its syntax and structure.

However, the course's well-structured content and clear instructions helped me overcome these challenges and learn effectively. The course content was well-paced, and I could easily follow the lessons, despite being new to Rust programming. Moreover, the practical assignments provided opportunities to apply the knowledge learned and practice the newly acquired skills.

## My Success

Despite the challenges, I am happy to say that I successfully completed the course. Throughout the course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of smart contracts and how to develop them using the CosmWasm framework. The practical examples and assignments provided throughout the course helped me to build my skills and confidence.

I am particularly proud of the smart contract I developed towards the end of the course. It was a significant milestone for me to be able to develop a working smart contract that can be deployed to a real blockchain network. This accomplishment has given me the confidence to explore more complex blockchain projects and develop more advanced smart contracts.

## Certification Exam

Unfortunately, I could not take the certification exam because the cohort had already ended by the time I finished the course. However, I am still delighted to have completed the course and have gained valuable knowledge that I can apply in future projects.

While not having the certification may be a minor setback, the knowledge and skills gained from the course are invaluable. I believe that the hands-on experience and knowledge gained through the course will be critical in any blockchain project I work on in the future.

## Conclusion

Overall, I am thrilled to have completed the "CosmWasm Smart Contracts Basics" course. It was an excellent learning experience that helped me acquire new skills and knowledge in blockchain development. The course was well-structured, challenging, and practical, which helped me to develop a strong foundation in blockchain technology.

I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about smart contracts, blockchain development, or the CosmWasm framework. The course has given me a solid understanding of blockchain technology, and I am excited to apply these skills to future projects.
