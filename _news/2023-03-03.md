Just got back from the 4th Annual European Medical Device And Diagnostic Cybersecurity Conference in Brussels. This time around I was joined by a colleague of mine responsible for our processes so we could split up and absorb both the cybersecurity and software topics. I had a fairly long chat with a former FDA employee which was enlightening. I also enjoyed various discussions around Threat Modeling methodologies and vulnerability management in general and as it pertains to product security as opposed to IT security. The last topic that really stuck to my mind was the upcoming regulations of the FDA with their pre-market draft as well as EU regulations and the aim for harmonization and convergence.
